    <p>I am not responsible for any data you put on the interent. No data is being collected or tracked. If you wish to recive a cookie i require all form fields to be filled out and that you agree to this, to submit it to my database. you do not need to put real info such as names. you need to select a flavor and house number so i know who is who. If by any unlikely chance that the data is hacked or stolen i am still not responsible for it. you can probably find all this information you submit about your self online in some way anyways. this is just a small project i built as a student.</p>
